# Scripts

This is a collection of helpful scripts I've written.  They're mostly basic things for my daily use.

mkpy - Makes a blank, executable py file in the current directory.
mkvenv - Creates a Python virtual environment in the current directory and activates it.
monthly_pay_conversion - Uses the mo_to_hr and mo_to_yr Python scripts to output hourly and yearly conversions of passed monthly pay rates.
mo_to_yr - Converts and outputs a yearly translation of a monthly payrate.
mo_to_hr - Converts and outputs an hourly translation of a monthly payrate.
idea_add - adds lines to the end of an idea file, placed in user's documents directory
